## UI/UX Design

For the UI protoype of the project, we used POP which is a prototyping application. The app is designed for phones and tables which is why the prototype is shown on an iPad.

The "File Management" button in the protoype is only visible for Instructor accounts. Everything else is accessible for both students and instructions.

The link to the UI is below. The website might take a bit of time to load the images.
